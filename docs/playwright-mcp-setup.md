# Playwright MCP Server Setup for Git Time Machine

## Implementation Plan

### Overview
Adding Playwright MCP (Model Context Protocol) server to enable automated visual testing for the Git Time Machine frontend. This will allow Claude Code to verify UI changes and test user interactions.

### Architecture
- **Frontend Testing**: React components with TypeScript
- **Test Framework**: Playwright with TypeScript support
- **MCP Integration**: Playwright MCP server for Claude Code integration
- **Test Coverage**: Component rendering, user interactions, API integration

### Tasks Breakdown

1. **Research Phase**
   - Investigate Playwright MCP server requirements
   - Review Claude Code MCP integration patterns
   - Understand testing needs for current components

2. **Dependencies Installation**
   - Add Playwright core packages
   - Configure TypeScript support
   - Install MCP server dependencies

3. **Configuration Setup**
   - Create playwright.config.ts
   - Configure test environments
   - Set up MCP server configuration

4. **Test Implementation**
   - Create tests for RepoForm component
   - Add tests for Timeline visualization
   - Test Summary component rendering
   - Add integration tests for full workflow

5. **Documentation**
   - Update package.json scripts
   - Document testing commands
   - Provide MCP server usage guide

### Reasoning
- **Visual Testing**: Playwright provides reliable browser automation for UI testing
- **MCP Integration**: Allows Claude Code to run tests and verify changes
- **Component Coverage**: Ensures all React components work correctly
- **Regression Prevention**: Automated tests catch breaking changes
- **Production Readiness**: Aligns with the requirement for production-worthy webpages

### MVP Scope
- Basic component rendering tests
- Form interaction testing
- MCP server integration
- Essential test scripts in package.json

### External Dependencies
- @playwright/test
- Playwright MCP server
- TypeScript configuration updates
