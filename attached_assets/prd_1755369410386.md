# Codebase Time Machine – Hackathon MVP PRD

## TL;DR
Codebase Time Machine is a dev tool that lets users explore how a feature (like authentication) evolved over time in a GitHub repo. Built with a Python backend + React frontend, it parses git history, summarizes relevant changes using GPT, and visualizes them in an interactive timeline.

---

## 🧩 Problem Statement

Developers struggle to understand how complex features evolved in large codebases. Git logs are noisy and don’t answer questions like:

> “When did we switch from session-based to token-based auth?”

This tool helps users understand feature evolution at a glance — combining git data, NLP, and simple visualizations.

---

## 🎯 Goals

### Business Goals
- Win hackathon with a polished demo
- Show value of AI + git + visualization
- Demonstrate a working MVP in < 60 seconds

### User Goals
- Input a GitHub repo and feature (e.g. “auth”)
- See a summarized timeline of key changes
- Understand high-level decisions over time

### Non-Goals
- Deep AST/code analysis
- Multi-feature tracking or large scale performance
- Real-time GitHub webhook sync

---

## 👤 User Stories

- As a dev joining a new project, I want to see how the auth system evolved.
- As a lead reviewing legacy code, I want to know when and why architectural shifts occurred.
- As a judge, I want to see a smooth demo that does one thing well.

## 🧭 User Experience (React UI)

1. User lands on a React frontend
2. Inputs a GitHub repo URL + optional topic (defaults to `auth`)
3. Submits → Python backend clones repo and parses git log
4. Backend filters commits related to topic (file names + keywords)
5. Sends grouped commits/diffs to LLM using structured prompt
6. Returns a narrative summary
7. React displays:
   - A clean evolution timeline (commit bubbles/cards)
   - Structured GPT summary
   - Links to relevant commits on GitHub

---

## 🧵 Narrative

Software moves fast. You join a team and inherit thousands of commits. You ask:
> “Why is this feature like this?”

We built **Codebase Time Machine** to answer that in 60 seconds.

Paste in any GitHub repo, and we’ll show you the full story of a feature — from V1 to refactors to major shifts. It’s like an onboarding assistant and code archeologist rolled into one.

We use GitPython, a curated prompt, and GPT to turn noisy git logs into a useful timeline — starting with authentication as our showcase.

## 📊 Success Metrics

| Metric | Goal |
|--------|------|
| E2E flow from repo input to summary | ✅ |
| Timeline renders and is easy to scan | ✅ |
| GPT summaries are relevant and insightful | ✅ |
| Total runtime < 60 seconds on demo repo | ✅ |
| Judges say "this is actually useful" | ✅✅✅ |

---

## 🧠 Technical Stack

| Layer | Tool |
|-------|------|
| Backend | Python (FastAPI or Flask) |
| Git Parsing | GitPython or PyDriller |
| LLM API | OpenAI GPT-4 API |
| Frontend | React (Vite/CRA) |
| Visualization | D3.js, Chart.js, or react-flow |
| Deployment | Replit (or optional Netlify for frontend) |

---

## 🔧 Technical Considerations

- Filter commits using:
  - File path match (`auth`, `login`, `jwt`, etc.)
  - Commit message keyword match
- Chunk commits into batches (10–20 at a time) to stay under token limits
- Use GPT API with temperature ~0.3 for consistency
- Cache clone & parse for faster dev testing
- Frontend makes a `/analyze` POST request to backend with repo + topic

---

## 🪜 Milestones & Sequencing

| Milestone | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| 🛠️ Backend Git Clone (0–2h) | Clone repo, parse git log, extract commit metadata |
| 🔍 Topic Commit Filter (2–4h) | Match commits by topic-relevant keywords |
| 🧠 GPT Integration (4–6h) | Send commits to GPT using `prompt.md` format |
| 🎨 React UI Skeleton (6–8h) | Form, loading state, summary display |
| 📈 Timeline View (8–10h) | Visualize key commits w/ date, message, summary |
| 🚀 Full Flow Test (10–12h) | Try on real repo (e.g. Supabase or NextAuth.js) |
| 🧽 Polish & Pitch (12–18h) | Add README, commit links, final demo script |

---

## 🚀 Demo Strategy

- Open with a relatable pain: “You join a repo… auth is everywhere… you ask ‘what happened here?’”
- Paste Supabase repo → click → show timeline of auth evolution
- End with GPT summary slide: “We migrated to JWTs in 2022 due to mobile API needs.”
