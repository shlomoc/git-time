- **Temperature Optimization**: Adapted to GPT-5's parameter constraints (uses default temperature of 1)
- **Improved Analysis Quality**: Better understanding of complex codebases and architectural patterns

### üîß Technical Changes
- **Backend**: Updated OpenAI API calls to GPT-5 compatibility
- **Dependencies**: Updated to `openai>=1.50.0` for GPT-5 support
